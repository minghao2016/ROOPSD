Description: Statistical distribution in OOP (Object Orientied Programming) way.
             This package proposes a R6 class interface to classic statistical
             distribution, and new distributions can be easily added with the
             class AbstractDist. A useful point is the generic fit method for
             each class, which uses a maximum likelihood estimation to find the
             parameters of a dataset. Furthermore, the rv_histogram class gives
             a non-parametric fit, with the same accessors that for the classic
             distribution. Finally, three random generators useful to build
             synthetic data are given: a multivariate normal generator, an
             orthogonal matrix generator, and a symetric positive definite
             matrix generator.
